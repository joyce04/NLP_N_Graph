Treatment . She is in a statin benefit group identified in the 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol guideline (primary LDL-C≥190 mg / dl (2) . No further risk assessment is necessary (indeed , pooled cohort equations do not accurately estimate risk when LDL-C≥190 mg / dl) (36) . Start atorvastatin 80 mg , a high-intensity statin as recommended by the 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol guideline for all adults≥21 yrs with LDL-C≥190 mg / dl unless there is a contraindication (2) . 3 . Contraception . The patient and her partner were counseled to continue effective contraception to avoid the potential risk of fetal harm from statin therapy . 4 . Life-style . She was encouraged to continue a heart-healthy diet , to have regular physical activity , to control weight , and to continue to avoid exposure to tobacco (2,42,43) . 5 . Cascade screen relatives . FH is autosomal dominant , and 50% of direct antecedents and descendants will be affected (41,44) . Less than 10% of FH patients have been identified and only 5% are adequately treated . Systematic identification and treatment of FH patients can reduce their risk to that of the general population . Children should have a nonfasting cholesterol measured at age 2 yrs if there is a family history of FH , and universally at age 8–10 yrs (44) . 6 . Follow-up . Lipid panel at 3 months .
