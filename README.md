# Natural Language Processing



### Overview of this repository

This repository is made for purpose of practicing diverse machine learning and natural languag processing for my person study and research.
I am majorly focused on extracting relational information from unstructured data. So I may not cover the whole known NLP techniques.



Overview of repository

1. Topic modeling - LDA (unigram, bigram, trigram)
2. K-means
3. String matching - Aho corasick(FlastText), Fuzzy string matching(Fuzzywuzzy)
4. Entity Recognition





Overview of NLP

1. Natural Language Processing

   - Tasks : 

     1) splitting text into sentences, words

     2) find POS(part of speech) for words in sentences.

     3) determine types of subclauses

     4) determine the subject and the direct object of a setence.

   - Morphology : how words are form, origin of words, how words change their forms depending on the context

     1) prefix/ suffix

     2) singularization / pluralization

     3) gender detection

     4) word inflection

     5) lemmatization

     6) spellcheck

   - Syntax : structure of sentences

     1) POS tagging (Noun/Verb/Adjective/Adverb/Pronoun/Preposition/Conjuction...)

     2) Syntax Trees

     3) Dependency Trees

   - Semantics : meaning

     1) Named Entity Recognition

     2) Relation Extraction

     3) Semantic Role Labelling

     4) Word sense disambiguation

   - Pragmatics : analyze the text as a whole

     1) Corefernece / Anaphora resolution

     2) Topic segmentation

     3) Lexical chains

     4) summarization
